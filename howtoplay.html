        <h1>Ouroboros King: How to Play</h1>
        <a href="index.html">Home</a>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        The rules of Ouroboros Chess are similar to standard chess.
        Here are the main differences:
        <ul>
            <li>Check and checkmate do not exist.
                Instead, you win by capturing your opponent's king.</li>
            <li>There are many types of pieces.
                You can always hover over a piece to explain its movement.</li>
            <li>Some tiles have special effects on them.*</li>
            <li>You can choose up to eight pieces
                (with a maximum of one king) to set up as your layout.</li>
            <li>Each player's layout is randomly placed on their
                side of the board.*</li>
        </ul>
        *Note: These are affected by the seed.
        Using the same seed allows for the same random setup for these.
